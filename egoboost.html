                <h1>Why exactly have i done all of this?</h1>
                <p style="color: white;">There is a certain pumpkin in this world who means a whole lot to me, and i wanted to do something to make this lil midget of a pumpkin chinese. I love you so fucking much Annie, and ive spent all weekend thinking about you. I hope you like everything i have done for you, icl i have put in a LOT of effort. Maybe it will convince you to stay, i hope so, but either way i hope this all finds you well. Because this controller bot has farmed smiles on this bri ish boi for a couple months now, so he gotta return the favour init. I miss you so much. And yes i did in fact code this entire website (not from scratch tho) and yes the video required an insane amount of editing and yes the scrolling in the video was really on x100. I know you may not see a future with us, but i genuinely do see one, i know and understand that it will be difficult tho but thats fine, i do think we can get thru it together. Dont use all of this as presssure to stay with me tho, make the decision based on how you feel after this, im just doing this so that i dont feel like i didnt try, and also to give you one last chinese smile if it ends up being the last one. Hopefully not but we could end up friends after this. And yeah im almost certain nobody else in your lifetime will do something as extreme as this so lucky you. Anyways enjoy!</p>
